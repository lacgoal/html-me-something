      <h1>Run, run, run, as fast as you can...</h1>
      <article class="">
        <p>I enjoy running.</p>
        <p>Not so much on the roads or on pavement, but on dirt, on a rocky path... </p>
        <p>On the trails, I feel like a kid running amok. The sights, smells, sounds...</p>
        <p>Give me a hill and I'll meet you at the top.</p>
        <p>A flat stretch and I'll meet you at the end.</p>
        <p>I may not look like your "typical runner" capable of fast speed.</p>

        <p>I'm fortunate to carry extra "fuel" for the long haul, going the distance.</p>

      <h3>She's going for distance...</h3>
      <p>Each week, the miles add up, and I get one step closer to my goal of running a trail marathon. My goa is to run the marathon around April/May in celebration of my craziness and of my birthday. </p>
      <p>The Kansas City area has an awesome group, called the Trail Nerdz, who have a long list of events planned for throughout the year. The distances range from the "beginner" 5&nbspk to the "veteran" 100&nbspmiler. My upcomign races include a 4-miler, a 10k, and then a 10-miler at the beginning of Dec.</p>

      <p>My plans don't end at running the marathon. Oh no, I'm crazy enough to think about running a 50k, then a 50&nbspmiler, then a 100&nbspk, then 100&nbspmiles... It's hard to explain why, but how I feel after each trip out on to the trails... That let's me know I'm doing something good and I have no plans of stopping. Maybe a good amount of walking, but not stopping.</p>
