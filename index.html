    <p>Two years ago, I was back home, in upstate New York, and I wasn't happy with the path I was on. I was surrounded by negative people and stuck in a job that wasn't a good fit for me. Mentally, I felt drained and physically, I felt gross. I had lost sight of my goals and ideas. Something needed to change.</p>
    <p>I began to list out the things that I enjoyed, goals that had been put on the backburner, and ideas of where I saw myself. This led to me outlining a plan. A plan of where I saw myself in 5 years.</p>
    <ol> 5-Year Plan
      <li>Career</li>
      <li>Happy</li>
      <li>Athletic</li>
      <li>New </li>
      <li>G</li>
      <li>Education</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Change was needed in order for this plan to take place. I couldn't stay in the same place otherwise the chance of falling back in to the same rut would be too easy. I dropped everything and moved cross-country, to the midwest, to begin a new path.</p>
